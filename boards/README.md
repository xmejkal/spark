# Board definitions

One file per board, holding everything the rest of the project needs to know about which
microcontroller this is: the silkscreen-to-GPIO map, which pins can wake it, which have an ADC,
which have a second job, which MicroPython build it runs, and what it is physically — its
footprint in the PCB design and its size on screen.

It exists because that knowledge was in six places — the firmware, the PCB design, the
simulator's part type, the pin-map checker, the placement code and a pile of comments — and six
copies of a fact are five chances to be wrong.

```text
spark/boards/                  the shipped LIBRARY — verified definitions, adopt without copying
  firebeetle2-esp32s3.json
  xiao-esp32-c6.json

your-project/
  boards/active.json           <- which board. THE one place it is chosen.
  boards/<id>.json             optional: your own definition. Yours always wins.
  .spark/board.json            GENERATED. The resolved, validated board every consumer reads.
```

A project needs **one file** to adopt a library board:

```json
{ "schema": 1, "board": "firebeetle2-esp32s3" }
```

A definition you verified yourself always beats a shared one, so a project's own `boards/<id>.json`
overrides the library. Nothing you have checked can be replaced by a plugin update.

## Switching board

```sh
boards.py --list          # what is available, and whether it is yours or the library's
$EDITOR boards/active.json # change the one line
boards.py --resolve       # -> .spark/board.json, validated
make check                # what still disagrees
```

Nothing else names a board. The resolver validates the active one and writes it to
`.spark/board.json`; Make, the firmware's spec generator and the simulator's diagram generator
all read that single file.

That indirection earns its place: the search and the schema check used to exist twice, once in
Python and once partially in TypeScript, and the shared library would have forced the second copy
to learn about a second directory. Resolving once means a consumer reads a file instead of
re-implementing a lookup.

## Adding a board

1. **Write `boards/<id>.json`.** Copy the closest existing one. `id` must match the filename.
2. **Get the pin map from the vendor's Arduino variant header**, not from a pinout picture:
   `espressif/arduino-esp32` → `variants/<board>/pins_arduino.h`. Pinout diagrams are drawn by
   marketing; the header is what the toolchain compiles against. Cross-check it against the
   vendor wiki and record both under `sources`.
3. **Get the chip's capabilities from `soc_caps.h`** in `espressif/esp-idf`:
   `SOC_RTCIO_PIN_COUNT` gives the wake-capable range, `SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT0_WAKEUP` says whether
   `esp32.wake_on_ext0` exists, `SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT1_WAKEUP_MODE_PER_PIN` whether wake pins may
   have different polarities. Guessing any of these costs a bench session.
4. **Check it**: `python3 tools/boards.py --validate`. The contract is enforced, not documented.
5. **Rework `config.py`'s pin assignments.** Which function sits on which pin is a design
   decision, not a board fact — see below.
6. **Swap the footprint in `board.tsx`** to the one named in `physical.footprint_export`.
   Until `footprint_module` and `footprint_export` are filled in, `--validate --for-fab` fails
   and `make` refuses to export gerbers, which is deliberate: an unverified footprint is the one
   mistake here that costs money.

## What is a board fact, and what is not

The line that keeps this file honest:

- **A board fact** is true of the hardware whatever you build with it — D9 is GPIO0, GPIO11 is
  on ADC2, GPIO38 cannot wake the chip. These go in `boards/<id>.json`.
- **A design decision** is a choice you made — which pin the OPEN button is on, whether buttons
  are wired to GND or 3V3 (and therefore `config.WAKE_ON_HIGH`). These go in `config.py`.

`wake_on_high` was briefly in a board file during the S3 switch and had to come out: it follows
from how the buttons are wired, not from the board. A board file that accumulates decisions
stops being swappable, which is the whole point of the directory.

Steps 1–4 are mechanical. Step 5 is real work, and no amount of structure avoids it: moving to a
board with more wake-capable pins is precisely the kind of change that should make you revisit
the pin map rather than transplant it. Going from the XIAO ESP32-C6 to the FireBeetle 2 ESP32-S3
took the wake-capable pin count from 3 usable to 22, which changed every assignment.

## Simulation

`wokwi_part_type` names the part the generated Wokwi diagram uses. If Wokwi has no model of the
exact board, a same-silicon devkit stands in and `wokwi_is_stand_in` says so — the diagram
addresses pins by GPIO number, so a stand-in costs only the silkscreen labels in the picture.

Wokwi custom boards exist but are a browser-only feature (F1 → "Load custom board file"):
`wokwi.toml` has no board key, and the simulator loads boards from a bundle Wokwi hosts. Getting
a board supported headlessly means a PR to `wokwi/wokwi-boards`.
