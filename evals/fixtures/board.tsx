/**
 * Smart bin, board v2 — Seeed XIAO ESP32-C6.
 *
 * This is the board the firmware in firmware/micropython/ expects and the simulation in
 * firmware/micropython/sim/ models. The three must agree; `tools/circuit-to-wokwi` regenerates
 * the simulation from this file and fails if they drift.
 *
 * What changed from v1 (board-v1-tb6612.tsx, kept for reference):
 *  - no OLED: the bin never had a screen, and a bicolour LED says everything it needs to.
 *  - L9110S instead of the TB6612: right current class, two inputs instead of three, and the
 *    same simple design the original board used.
 *  - a VL6180X time-of-flight rangefinder replaces the IR pair, on I2C.
 *  - the pin map moved, because **only GPIO0-7 can wake an ESP32-C6 from deep sleep** — on the
 *    XIAO that is D0, D1 and D2, so those three carry the sensor interrupt, the OPEN button and
 *    the one analogue input.
 *  - the MP3 module's TXD is deliberately not wired: powered from the LiPo its idle level
 *    exceeds what this chip tolerates, and nothing reads it.
 *
 * Pin map (D-pin = GPIO): D0=0 D1=1 D2=2 D3=21 D4=22 D5=23 D6=16 D7=17 D8=19 D9=20 D10=18.
 *
 * The outline is 70 x 45 mm, and it is set by what sits on it. Only three things do: the XIAO,
 * the motor driver and the MP3 module. The rangefinder has to look out through the lid and the
 * speaker sits behind a grille, so both are on ribbons to their own 2.54 mm headers and take no
 * board area at all — modelling them as plug-in modules is what made an earlier layout collide
 * with itself. `tools/check-module-clearance.py` reads the 3D bodies back out of the build and
 * reports anything that overlaps or hangs off the edge.
 *
 * The outline still has to be checked against the bin's own cavity before anything is ordered.
