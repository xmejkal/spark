/**
 * A pin's name and the label on its pad are not always the same word.
 *
 * The FireBeetle brings SPI out on pads silkscreened `MI`, `MO` and `SCK`, while the board file
 * keys those GPIOs by the names the vendor's own Arduino header uses — `MISO`, `MOSI`. Both are
 * correct. They are not the same string.
 *
 * `labelForGpio` answered with the vendor's name, and the firmware-pins check compares that
 * answer against `mcu-pins.ts`, which has to name the pad because that is what `board.tsx`
 * writes a trace to. So the moment a signal landed on GPIO15 the check would report `MOSI` and
 * `MO` as a mismatch: a disagreement between two correct statements, which is the kind of false
 * alarm that gets a check switched off rather than fixed.
 *
 * Found while moving the audio to I2S, which is the first design to use those three pads.
