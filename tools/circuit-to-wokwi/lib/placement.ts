/**
 * Where parts sit in the diagram.
 *
 * Deliberately dumb, and that is the design: generated files have to be **diffable**. A layout
 * engine (elkjs can do this properly, with fixed port positions) would move everything whenever
 * one pin changed, and the diff would be unreadable. A deterministic heuristic moves one part.
 *
 * The board sits at the origin; everything else stacks in a column either side of it, in the
 * order the mapping table prefers, snapped to Wokwi's grid.
 *
 * `Placer` is an interface so a better implementation can be dropped in without the emitter
 * noticing — and `merge.ts` means a human's own positions win over either of them.
