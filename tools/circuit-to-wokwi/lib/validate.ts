/**
 * Prove the generated diagram is worth trusting, offline, before it is written.
 *
 * Two checks, answering different questions:
 *
 *   lint      — "is this a valid Wokwi project?"   Wokwi's own rules and part registry
 *   coverage  — "does it simulate *this* board?"   every net that could be wired, was
 *
 * The second is the one this tool exists for. A diagram that lints perfectly but silently lost a
 * net is a simulation quietly disagreeing with the hardware, which is worse than no simulation.
