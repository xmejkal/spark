/**
 * Keep what a human decided, replace what the design decides.
 *
 * The generator owns *what is connected to what*. A person owns *what it looks like* — where the
 * parts sit, how the wires are routed, and any part added by hand that the board does not have
 * (a logic analyser, a probe LED). Regenerating must not throw that away, or nobody will
 * regenerate.
 *
 * So: positions, rotations and wire routes are carried over from the existing file by part id,
 * and hand-added parts are kept if they are marked. Everything else comes from the board.
